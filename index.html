                Hello! I am Ruimian, the president of Math Club, and I want to welcome
                you to our club! I am passionate about math since it helps me
                appreciate the beauty of the world from another perspective. I love
                challenging myself with interesting math problems and applying math to
                real world situations. In my free time, I like to listen to music and
                play the piano. I am also fond of exploring and hiking because I
                always discover new things in my journey.

                Hi guys! My name is Vivien. I’m excited to be one of the executives of
                math club this year! I enjoy doing math because it is very satisfying
                when you solve something that you’ve been working on for a while. Some
                things I like to do in my free time include coding, doing origami,
                watching documentaries, and playing with my dog. I look forward to
                meeting you guys!

                Hello, I’m Sofine. It’s so exciting that I’ll be contributing content
                for the social media and activities of our math club this year! Just
                to introduce myself a little bit: I’m really into solving interesting
                math problems and practicing coding for some interesting little
                projects. Also, I enjoy painting animals and architecture and reading
                animal-related books and documentaries from all around the world.
